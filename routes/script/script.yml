  Hi! Welcome! We’ll be starting in a few minutes, but find a seat, say hi to
  your neighbor! If you haven't yet, grab a **waffle** which is included with
  your ticket. Hit up the **drink car** and grab some food! We also have
  **blanket seating** up front if you want to get a front row seat! If you see
  an **empty seat, you can take it** and say hi to your new neighbor.

  **Hello**

  EMILY

    Hi! My name is **Emily**.

  VISNU

    Hi! My name is **Visnu**. Welcome to WaffleJS and thank you for coming
    tonight. You should’ve met **Billy** and **Kelly** too on your way in. They
    likely checked you in and pointed out the waffles. We’re all organizers, so
    if you need anything feel free to grab us.

    Lots of people here, which I’m sure you’re feeling if you’re stuck
    standing. So please if you’re a lucky seated person, please crowd in and
    get comfy and try to make room for one or two more people to sit next to
    you. And definitely, if you see an **empty seat, please take it** but you
    just have to **say hi to your new neighbor**. Also, if hanging out and
    talking is more your thang, feel free to chill in the area outside so
    people who want to see and hear the talks can do that.


  **Talks**

  EMILY

    So we have a total of **4x 10ish-minute lightning talks** with
    **{{script.speakers[0].name}}** and **{{script.speakers[1].name}}** going
    first, then a nice little intermission. At the end of intermission,
    **{{script.performers[0][0].name}}** will be performing, followed by
    **{{script.speakers[2].name}}** and finally **{{script.speakers[3].name}}**
    after that.

    We’ve got lots of stuff packed into two hours, so **if you’ve got
    questions** we encourage you to find your favorite speaker **after their
    talk** and ask them all your questions.


  **Bevera.js + Karaoke**

  VISNU

    If you’re down to hang out afterwards, we’re going to **Butter** for
    karaoke and drinks tonight which is just **1-block north on 11th Street**.
    We call it Bevera.js and Karaoke, with naming credits to **Will Duffy**
    from Brooklyn JS.


  **Wed, May 4**

  EMILY

    This is the **?th WaffleJS**! We have it the **first Wednesday of every
    month**, always in this nice cozy barn. The next one is **?** and if
    you have fun tonight, you should come to that one too and **bring your
    friends and co-workers and pets**.

    If you have an idea for a **talk for upcoming months**, please submit them
    via GitHub or email us at talks@wafflejs.com or come pitch the idea to us
    on Slack. If you’re interested in performing in between the talks, also
    email us or find us. So if you like to sing or play the theremin or
    accordion or dance, contact us at perform@wafflejs.com!


  **Student Sponsors**

  VISNU

    We would like to give a **special thank you** to the attendees here who
    bought a **student sponsor ticket**. That ticket pays for a student to
    attend for free. We’ve been trying to increase our student attendance
    because we believe coding is more than fingers on a keyboard: it’s social.
    So, if you personally know any students (and by students we mean anyone at
    all who is learning to code be it at a hacker school or full-time
    university or self-guided program), please let them know about this event.
    If you know of a **student who would like to give a talk**, we’d especially
    love to hear from them.


  **Code of Conduct**

  EMILY

    We expect everyone here to follow the JSConf Code of Conduct. If you’ve
    never read it, we encourage you to go read the whole thing. But in short:
    
    > WaffleJS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meet-up experience
    for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability,
    physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate
    harassment of attendees in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
    appropriate in any medium, including talks (or even just casual
    conversation arriving, during and after the event). WaffleJS participants
    violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meet-up
    without a refund at the discretion of the organizers. If you see, hear, or
    over-hear anything that makes you uncomfortable, please find one of us and
    we’ll do what we can to make it right. And as always please remember to
    drink responsibly.

    We’ve been amazingly happy how month after month we get compliments from
    people saying how everyone who attends WaffleJS is super nice. It really
    warms our hearts. But we’re also not immune to people just being people and
    have had a few incidents in the past.

    We want to give you as many ways to contact us as possible. So if you can’t
    immediately find one of us in person if you see or hear something, you can
    DM @wafflejs on Twitter. You can anonymously text 650-735–0005 which we’ll
    get. Or you can go to https://wafflejs.com/conduct and fill out this form.
