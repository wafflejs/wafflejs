About
-----
WaffleJS is a monthly meetup centered around programming, waffles, and karaoke. It started when Visnu and Billy went to [BrooklynJS][1]. They were inspired by the event and wanted to organize a Bay Area technology meetup that would do these things:

- Have attendees actually meet and talk to one another.
- Promote a diverse and inclusive environment.
- Get people to have fun.

Today the meetup is co-organized by [Visnu][@visnup], [Billy][@billyroh], and
[Kelly][@kng], and hosted by [Emily][@nexxylove] and Visnu. It's held at [SoMa
StrEat Food Park][2] every first Wednesday of the month.

History
-------
The first session was in August 2015 and it has been held monthly ever since.
We use funds to cover the cost of food, the venue, and equipment. We donate
all profits to [Girls Who Code][3], a non-profit that encourages more women to
enter STEM fields.

Speakers & Attendees
--------------------
Our past speakers have worked as developers at established companies, as well
as smaller startups. Here are a few of those companies:

- Google
- Mozilla
- Dropbox
- Square
- Stripe
- npm

Our attendees are roughly the same ratio of people from larger and smaller
companies, leaning toward smaller startups. Around 35% of our attendees are
women.

Diversity
---------
We believe this industry can and should be more inclusive. Here are the
things we do to make that happen:

- **Donations:** We donate all proceeds to Girls Who Code, a non-profit that
  encourages more women to enter the STEM field.
- **Student sponsorships:** We sponsor students to come to the event so they
  can meet more people in the industry. So far, we’ve had students from
  Hackbright and Hack Reactor.
- **Diverse speakers:** We make sure that we have a wide range of speakers
  at each of our events, with an eye toward gender, racial, and socioeconomic
  diversity.
