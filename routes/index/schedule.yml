      description: At npm, we've had some pretty excellent luck with hiring.
        But even we get it wrong sometimes. Here's a 10-step breakdown of what
        we do now (and how it differs from other hiring processes).

      title: Turning a room into a synthesizer with a distributed harmonic
        series
      description: Let’s talk about what a harmonic series is. This natural
        phenomena tells us quite a bit about the symmetry found in our
        physiology and how our brain interprets it is fascinating. We’ll
        discover why certain instruments sound the way they do, and why some
        instruments are better suited for rhythm than percussion. We’ll also
        turn the room into a giant distributed synthesizer and make some noise.
