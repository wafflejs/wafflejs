**How do I submit a talk?**
You can either comment on this issue or send us an email at talks@wafflejs.com.

**When and where will it be?**
When: Wednesday, {date:MMMM dd} from 7 to 10 PM Pacific.
Where: Streaming on Zoom and YouTube

**What should I talk about?**
We don’t have a strict formula, but this is the balance we try to strike every month:
- **2x Creative Talks**: Creative applications of programming. Past examples are generating lego murals out of static images, and building an in-browser RPG.
- **1x Passion Talk**: Something you’re excited about outside of work. Past examples are starting and maintaining an open source project, and using meditation and programming side by side.
- **1x Technical Talk**: A deep dive on a technical topic. Past examples are optimizing your code for the V8 JavaScript engine, and using functional programming for developing UI.

**Do I need to be an expert to talk?**
Nope. This meetup is supposed to be fun and casual, so we want everyone to participate. We especially encourage people of underrepresented groups to apply.

**How long should my talk be?**
Ten minutes. There won't be any formal Q&A.

**What should be in my talk submission?**
We don’t have a strict formula for this either, but past successful submissions have included the following:

* What the audience should take away from the talk
* Why you’re excited about the subject
* A general outline of your talk (bullet points are good)

If you only have a rough idea, we’re also happy to workshop your idea with you on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mq3k5Jh).

**Do I have to buy a ticket if I get selected?**
Nope! You'll get a free ticket.

**What's the A/V situation?**
We'll be streaming via Zoom and multicasting to YouTube. You should sign up for Zoom and have a microphone (and maybe webcam). You can use either the Zoom app or their webapp. If you're playing audio (or video with sound), Zoom lets you "share screen _with computer audio_".

**Can I submit a talk for a thing I made, for either myself or my employer?**
Generally, no. We've found that when people give talks about a thing they made, it comes off as self-promotional. We'll make exceptions for this though, especially when it's less about the thing, but rather lessons learned by making the thing.
