**How do I submit a performance?**
You can either [submit a new issue](https://github.com/wafflejs/wafflejs.github.io/issues/new?assignees=&labels=pitch&template=pitch-your-talk.md), comment on this issue or send us an email at perform@wafflejs.com.

If you only have a rough idea, weâ€™re also happy to workshop your idea with you on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mq3k5Jh).

**When and where will it be?**
When: Wednesday, {date:MMMM dd} from 7 to 10 PM Pacific.
Where: Streaming on Zoom and YouTube

**What kind of performance are you looking for?**
It can be karaoke, plate-spinning, or fire-eating. If you're into, we're into it.

**How long should my performance be?**
It should be <6 min long, so no Hotel California please!

**Do I have to buy a ticket if I get selected?**
Nope! You'll get a free ticket.

**What should be in my submission?**
A description of what you'll be performing.

**What's the A/V situation?**
We'll be streaming via Zoom and multicasting to YouTube. You should sign up for Zoom and have a microphone (and maybe webcam). You can use either the Zoom app or their webapp. If you're playing audio (or video with sound), Zoom lets you "share screen with computer audio".
