        description: |
          Section 230 was a part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. While the act
          itself was meant to restrict free speech, Section 230 has allowed internet companies to
          operate as distributors of information, like bookstores, instead of traditional publishers,
          such as newspapers. The consequences of this freedom has been both
          good and bad. I'm going to talk about the challenges of keeping people safe while
          companies have started to moderate abuse, hate speech, and disinformation.

          thoughts and smiles, we move on to big laughs and ecstatic ecstaticness, finishing with a
          relaxation and contemplation. He has intentionally created this practice to explore feeling
          fantastic, and also for us to contemplate and cultivate positive states of mind.
          The outcome is to brain program these in the other areas of our life.

          relaxation and contemplation. He has intentionally created this practice to explore feeling

          You may have seen errors like these when you attempt to run a deeply recursive function. Computers can be so dramatic! But what‚Äôs the conflict, exactly, between recursion and call stacks? And is there any hope for resolving it into a happy ending? In this musical talk we'll see why recursion poses a problem for our finite-memory call stack, and learn how "Tail Call Optimization" (TCO) lets us get around that problem.<br><br>
          We‚Äôll sing our way through the meaning of these terms to explore how TCO messes with the call stack (in a useful way!), as we mess with the lyrics to some of our favorite animated musical songs (in a nerdy way!).

          Spring is in the air (well, somewhere), and that means a whole new crop
          of new grads are about to hit the workplace! Maybe you've extended offers
          to one or a few, and congratulations! New grads are great! In my past
          year as a new grad myself, I've seen some wonderful teams train up some
          wonderful new engineers, designers, product managers, developer advocates,
          and more! Aaaand I've also seen some missteps along the way. In this talk
          I'll go through some moves that were great, and some tips I had to learn
          the hard way, to help you train up your new grad to be happy and healthy at work.

          As babies, many of us learn to talk by unconsciously figuring out how
          to move the muscles in our face. Let‚Äôs learn to talk again, but this
          time by looking into what‚Äôs going on under the hood!
          Pink Trombone (https://dood.al/pinktrombone/) is a web tool that lets
          users create sounds by interacting with a virtual oral cavity, nasal
          cavity, tongue, and throat. Are those building blocks actually enough
          for speech, and can we teach Pink Trombone to speak English words?
          What sounds are especially difficult to produce - for humans, and in
          the app - and why? Join me in digging into the technology behind this
          app and learning more about how our voices really work.

        title: Master your Domain with GraphQL
        description: |
          GraphQL pushes us to think differently about how we design our data models. 
          This introduces not just a technical shift, but also a shift in how we 
          collaborate on product teams. I'm excited about these changes and maybe, 
          by the end of this talk, you will be too.

        description: |
          Word embeddings are an incredibly popular tool in modern NLP, but they've predominantly been used on
          living languages. What are the applications to using word embeddings in languages no longer spoken
          (Latin, Ancient Greek, etc.), and what are the challenges faced? I'm excited to talk about work I've
          done using word embeddings to better understand the poetry of an Augustan poet, Propertius, and how 
          Latin word embeddings pose different challenges from training them on a language like English.

          moon.<br /><br />
          We'll write code that calculates the percent illumination of the moon based on the
          current position of the moon and sun, and step by step, go over the trigonometry proofs
          that show how it works.

          Functional programming has become more and more prevalent with javascript
          developers. Transforming data into UI views with deterministic functions
          was a powerful idea that took the industry by storm when React debuted. I
          believe you can build not just your views, but your entire application
          with just deterministic functions. I'll show you how I approach the
          problem!

          Navigating code review comments can be difficult, especially when the feedback is given in
          tones that are harsh, blunt, and sometimes downright rude. Senior Software Engineer, Angie
          Jones, will share the 10 guidelines she follows for navigating code reviews. These
          practical tips will help lead to a productive process that will help you get your code
          accepted faster, and without the drama.

          Most people think of P2P networks as just a playground for file sharing applications, but it
          turns out you can build other types of applications with useful characteristics such as
          enhanced privacy and security. Using the example of building a cloud file storage system
          (think Dropbox) that instead runs on a P2P network, we‚Äôll walk through the process of
          building an increasingly complex system to touch on topics such as scaling a network‚Äôs size
          and preserving data without a database.

          the "internet programming" environment that Apple built for kids in the late 90s. I'll
          fire up a Mac OS 7 emulator and show what made Cocoa so groundbreaking. I'll explain
          how "programming by demonstration" and "actor-based" educational environments lower the
          barrier to entry in computer science and establish mental models that make it easier for
          kids to write great JavaScript later. tldr: Don't teach kids to write for loops, teach
          them to think about state machines and scopes!

                     that has light animations depending on the realtime state of your Uber ride! We'll be going over
                     the basics of microcontroller programming along the way and some tools you can use to get started.

          As web developers, we want apps to run at a silky smooth 60 frames per second.
          But there are lots of gotchas (e.g. animating background color) that can make
          it hard for the browser to paint pixels to the screen fast enough. I'll explain what
          we're doing in Firefox to fix this and make pages run at maximum FPS.

          Practical Things You Can Do to Protect the Privacy of Your Users
        description: |
          Protecting privacy is the right thing to do. Consider especially that
          a few of your users may be people such as political dissidents or
          victims of domestic abuse that are especially vulnerable to privacy
          violation. Protecting privacy also makes business sense. You want to
          protect against a big data breach that could destroy your company's
          reputation, or to comply with upcoming European privacy regulations
          that apply to all apps worldwide. However privacy can be hard to get a
          handle on, because it is often explained using legal jargon. In this
          talk I speak as a fellow developer and outline the practical
          engineering things you can do, concentrating on protecting data you
          store in your backends.

          "Works for Me": Understanding Privilege in Tech
        description: |
          "Works for me." The words spoken to dismiss a thousand bugs. "Can't Reproduce." Issue closed. "You're getting worked up over nothing." "It was just a joke." "I worked just as hard to get here." "It didn't bother me." Problem dismissed. "Works for me" is a natural reaction when confronted with cultural issues that don't impact us directly. It's a statement that isn't inaccurate, but is wildly incomplete. We have to learn to see past our own experiences and see and accept the experiences of others. This talk will dive into how and why dismissal of culture concerns happens in the tech community, and how we can combat it with knowledge and empathy.

        description:
          Some numbers seem to be extra cool in the world of computer science -
          256, 128, and of course, all of those 0's and 1's that make up binary.
          But there's one number that's super magical, and almost all of us have
          interacted with it as JavaScript developers. The number 16! This talk
          will look at the awesomeness of hexadeimcal numbers. We'll explore the
          logic behind color hex codes, and the math that's behind converting
          between rgb and hex codes. Behind the hex codes that we are all
          familiar with is a powerful hexadecimal number systems. We'll explore
          why the base 16 number system is so common in computer science, and
          look at hexadecimals in the wild (for example, in hex speak and even
          in IP addresses!). Let's fall under the spell of hexadecimal numbers
          and learn why exactly they are so powerful and popular.

          performance linear algebra and numeric computation. And finally, I
          will show how web applications using WebAssembly can achieve near
          native speed, thus ushering in a whole new era of high performance
          applications for data analysis, graphics, and data visualization.

          web apps even more awesome) At the same time I had been wanting to

          way I could go anywhere and set the mood with my handy-dandy portable

          building responsive and highly-performant interfaces. But all
          of what React does feels like it's happening in a black box!
          So, I hope to explain why React is so efficient by
          highlighting 2 key features -- React's virtual DOM and diff
          algorithm. Don't worry if you're not a React pro, this talk

        title: Embracing change as an Open Source product
        emoji: üîÑ
        description: |
          The Open Source project I work on, BOSH, has been able to adapt to changing
          product and engineering needs over the past 3 years. I'll talk about some of
          the major changes that we've made while growing our contributor base. We
          transitioned from waterfall to XP, scaled our team to be globally distributed,
          and replaced core architectural components with zero downtime. While the
          tech industry routinely encounters these challenges, doing so as an OS
          product and maintaining shared vision throughout presents unique challenges.

          With the `async` and `await` keywords defined in
          the latest draft standard, you can write code combining the
          results of lots of asynchronous processes as easily as if
          their results were all immediately available. This feature
          is implemented in the latest beta versions of Chrome and Firefox
          and you can get them anywhere by means of closure-compiler.

          experiment with it on your own!

          Testing front-end is tricky, it‚Äôs easy to become lenient on
          implementing front-end tests. But as many of you have experienced,
          changing just a little bit on a legacy-ish front-end application
          can become a daunting and sometimes scary. Hopefully, selenium
          which is an automated UI testing tool can help ease those concerns.
          In this talk, I‚Äôll introduce what selenium is, how to get up and running.

          your high-impact 3-month project down to 2 weeks!
          The next day, you want to flip a table because
          nobody knows how to use this API. Stack Overflow
          has failed you. Documentation is clearly a novella
          rather than being straightforward. What do you do?
          Do you just give up and build from scratch? No!
          In this talk, you will learn not to give up in these
          situations. Like Nancy Drew, you can hunt down the
          information you need and save the world... or at

        description: |
          This talk looks beyond origami as a childhood
          pastime and an art form and explores origami
          as a source of many interesting mathematical
          problems, including one called the
          fold-and-cut problem. The fold and cut theorem
          states that it is possible, given a piece of
          paper and any polygonal shape, to find a
          series of folds of that paper such that the
          given shape can be generated with a single cut.
          This talk explores a proof of the theorem and
          an implementation of a solver that determines
          the correct series of folds given any input
          polygon. There will be a live demo of the
          program and paper cutting!

          on a tool for maintaining icons and making it easy for
          developers on any platform to use the icons in their
          apps. Hear about our iterative approach to rolling out

          Sometimes, programming is boring. We always talk about
          it as if we're on a rocket ship that's powered by jetfuel, when really
          sometimes it's painfully mind-numbing. This talk is a
          funny take on the doldrums of the in-and-outs of programming
          professionally, that's also hopefully inspiring in its own way.
