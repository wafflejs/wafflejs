          The Magic of Erasure Codes
        description: |
          Imagine you had a set of 100 files, and you could
          generate 4 extra files that could later recover up to 4 missing
          files from the set. Sound like magic? Fortunately, it’s real,
          and by the end of this talk, you’ll know how it works!

          Coffee is an essential part of many developers' lives, but
          sometimes we need to cut back. In this talk, I'll show you how a
          small team of engineers safely and efficiently converted hundreds
          of thousands of lines of CoffeeScript, spanning thousands of files
          into modern JavaScript over a short span of time. I'll go over why
          we made the switch, how I got buy-in, and how the team was able to
          stay productive throughout the conversion.

          "Works for Me": Understanding Privilege in Tech
        description: |
          "Works for me." The words spoken to dismiss a thousand bugs. "Can't Reproduce." Issue closed. "You're getting worked up over nothing." "It was just a joke." "I worked just as hard to get here." "It didn't bother me." Problem dismissed. "Works for me" is a natural reaction when confronted with cultural issues that don't impact us directly. It's a statement that isn't inaccurate, but is wildly incomplete. We have to learn to see past our own experiences and see and accept the experiences of others. This talk will dive into how and why dismissal of culture concerns happens in the tech community, and how we can combat it with knowledge and empathy.

          Some numbers seem to be extra cool in the world of computer science -
          256, 128, and of course, all of those 0's and 1's that make up binary.
          But there's one number that's super magical, and almost all of us have
          interacted with it as JavaScript developers. The number 16! This talk
          will look at the awesomeness of hexadeimcal numbers. We'll explore the
          logic behind color hex codes, and the math that's behind converting
          between rgb and hex codes. Behind the hex codes that we are all
          familiar with is a powerful hexadecimal number systems. We'll explore
          why the base 16 number system is so common in computer science, and
          look at hexadecimals in the wild (for example, in hex speak and even
          in IP addresses!). Let's fall under the spell of hexadecimal numbers
          and learn why exactly they are so powerful and popular.

          WebAssembly, a new portable compilation target for the web, promises
          to radically change how we build web applications. In this talk, I
          will provide an overview of WebAssembly and its current implementation
          status. I will next walk through a brief step-by-step example which
          involves compiling low-level BLAS libraries to WebAssembly for high-
          performance linear algebra and numeric computation. And finally, I
          will show how web applications using WebAssembly can achieve near
          native speed, thus ushering in a whole new era of high performance
          applications for data analysis, graphics, and data visualization.

          I'm a huge fan of mood lighting and app reliability. Related? Of
          course!  I heard about Progressive Web Apps and thought it was a
          great way to make web applications more accessible, so I wanted to
          give it a try. (Disclaimer🤓  I don't think PWAs are going to replace
          mobile apps just yet, but I do think they're a great way to make our
          web apps even more awesome) At the same time I had been wanting to
          create an application that let me control Philips Hue lights. That
          way I could go anywhere and set the mood with my handy-dandy portable
          lights. So, if I went outside to enjoy my yard, on the roof to hang
          out with friends, or WaffleJS to chill with amazing people, I could
          easily set the appropriate mood lighting with my app.  I would like
          to share my experience with all of you and show off my new toys 😊

          React is a declarative, component-based JavaScript library
          designed to manage the view layer of complex UIs. In recent
          years, it has established itself as the dominant library for
          building responsive and highly-performant interfaces. But all
          of what React does feels like it's happening in a black box!
          So, I hope to explain why React is so efficient by
          highlighting 2 key features -- React's virtual DOM and diff
          algorithm. Don't worry if you're not a React pro, this talk
          is intended to be accessible to all audiences!

          We have become the largest producers of data in history. Almost every click online, each swipe on our tablets and each tap on our smartphone produces a data point in a virtual repository. There are living, breathing humans behind these spreadsheets and they took actions to create these data points. For this talk, I will talk about creating interactive graphics to visualize our digital footprints in ways that allows us to explore humanity with all its wondrous quirks.

            Building GraphQL Backend
        description: |
            GraphQL is a powerful technology providing client an efficient and elegant way to fetch data,
            getting exactly the data and avoid multiple round-trips. I'm a co-author of library called Allograph.
            Allograph aims to integrate the various tools around GraphQL to provide a rapid development framework
            to enhance developer experience. After the talk, you'll gain deeper understanding on GraphQL itself,
            with perspectives on how to build a GraphQL backend either alongside an existing app or from scratch.

          There are some cool new ways for devs to build apps without needing to
          focus on or worry about devOps, scaling, or paying hourly for serverless.
          This talk will talk about how you might be able to use some of these new
          "function as a service" providers (AWS, Google, IBM, Microsoft, etc) in
          your next (work or personal) project. 🎉

          Building applications that are resilient to hostile networks and governments is
          not a matter swapping out one service for another, it requires that we
          rethink many of our assumptions about trust and infrastructure. It requires
          that we build a lot more open source software infrastructure to make the
          basic tools like signing and encryption as usable as we've made the rest
          of our software infrastructure.

          and replaced core architectural components with zero downtime. While the
          tech industry routinely encounters these challenges, doing so as an OS
          product and maintaining shared vision throughout presents unique challenges.

          and you can get them anywhere by means of closure-compiler.

          In this talk, you will learn not to give up in these

        description: |
          This talk looks beyond origami as a childhood
          pastime and an art form and explores origami
          as a source of many interesting mathematical
          problems, including one called the
          fold-and-cut problem. The fold and cut theorem
          states that it is possible, given a piece of
          paper and any polygonal shape, to find a
          series of folds of that paper such that the
          given shape can be generated with a single cut.

          one of the fastest growing demographics of social

          2016 has been a good year for Feminism and our
          industry is talking about it. But if it's been a while since
          Womens' Studies class, it's easy to misunderstand the context
          of this moment in a larger history of Women's Lib. I'll do a little
          overview of the 4 waves of Feminism, talk about ways to spot
          toxic patriarchy, and give some suggestions on how to be your
          best Tech Feminist!

          sometimes it's painfully mind-numbing. This talk is a

          professionally, that's also hopefully inspiring in its own way.

        title: Exploring Mental Illness through Open Source
        description: For almost a year, Julia has been leading if me, an open
          source mental health community. It has allowed her to explore personal
          insecurities with mental illness, taught her how to manage and value
          contributors, and develop more robust web apps using Ruby on Rails
          and JS. She will be delving into the lessons she’s learned
          transforming a passion project into an open source project.

          value to this namaste shit after all.
